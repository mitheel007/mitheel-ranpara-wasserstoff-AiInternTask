 Technology Stack

 Document Research & Theme Identification Chatbot

This project implements a document research and theme identification system using the following technologies:

 Core Framework

- Next.js: React framework providing both frontend and API functionality
- TypeScript: Strongly-typed JavaScript for improved code quality and developer experience
- React: Component-based UI library for building the interface


 UI Components & Styling

- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- shadcn/ui: Accessible component system built on Radix UI primitives
- Lucide React: Lightweight icon library with consistent design


 Document Processing

- JavaScript Vector Database: Custom implementation for semantic search capabilities
- Document Chunking: Algorithm to split documents into manageable segments for improved search relevance
- Vector Embeddings: Technique to convert text into numerical representations for semantic comparison


 Search & Analysis

- Semantic Search: Meaning-based document retrieval using vector similarity
- Cosine Similarity: Mathematical approach to measure document relevance
- Theme Identification: Custom algorithm to extract common themes across multiple documents
- Citation Mapping: System to link search results back to source documents with page/paragraph references


 Data Visualization

- Interactive UI: Real-time response display with tabbed interface
- Theme Visualization: Visual representation of document-theme relationships


 State Management

- React Hooks: For component-level state management
- Server Actions: For handling server-side operations


 Development Tools

- ESLint: Code quality and style checking
- Vercel: Deployment platform optimized for Next.js applications


This technology stack enables the application to process multiple documents, perform semantic search across them, identify common themes, and provide detailed citations - all within a browser environment without requiring server-side processing.
